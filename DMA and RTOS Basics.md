### **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**
DMA allows peripherals to access memory (read or write) without the CPU being involved. This allows for a reduced time latenency for peripheral I/O transactions, allows the CPU to do other operations or to be idle and an idle CPU can be put into low power mode, reducing power consumption. 
However, it requires extra hardware such as the DMA controller and increases the complexity and cost of microcontrollers
