## **Finite State Machine Controllers**
A FSM defines a sequence of operations that can be implemented in software or hardware. 

**Moore Machine** Outputs are dependent on the current state of the controller

## **Serial Interfacing** 
Allow communication between digital devices using sequential-based signalling - e.g. square waves

### Variants 
**Simple Signalling**
> Simple signaling refers to the basic method of transmitting signals between devices using simple on-off or binary signaling. In simple signaling, information is conveyed by the presence or absence of a signal, often represented by voltage levels or other physical quantities.
> Handshaking is a protocol used between two communicating devices to establish and synchronise communication. It involves a series of predefined steps or signals exchanged between the sender and receiver to ensure that both parties are ready to transmit and receive data.

**I2C Bus**
> I2C Bus allows for multi-master and multi-slave communication protocol. It has a two-wire interface, the Serial Data Line used for bidirectional data transfer between the master and slave devices, and the Serial Clock Line for synchronising the data transfer between the master and slave.

**Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)**
> Typically there is a master (microcontroller) that initiates and controls the data exchange and there are one or more slave devices that respond to the commands from the master. SPI communication uses multiple serial data lines:
>   * Master out Slave in (MOSI): Used by the master to transmit data to the slave device(s).
>   * Master in Slave Out (MISO): Used by the slave device(s) to transmit data back to the master
>   * Serial Clock (SCK): The clock signal generated by the master device to synchronise data transfer.

**Universal Asynchronous Receive Transmit (UART)**
> UART operates asynchronously, meaning that data is transmitted without the need for a shared clock signal between the transmitter and receiver. Instead, both devices agree on a common baud rate (data transfer rate) to synchronize the transmission and reception of data. This type of communication requires two lines, a Transmit Data (TX) line and a Receive Data (RD) data line. In the transmitted data each data byte is framed by start and stop bits which provide synchronisation and framing for the transmitted data.
