### Coding Hamming (7,4)
Hamming distance is the number of bits which differ between two words. 
Hence, Hamming (7,4) can correct for words which differ by a distance of 1. Can detect errors of distance 2 and distance 3 corresponds to valid code-words again.

**CRC16**
CRC16 (Cyclic Redundancy Check 16) is a type of cyclic redundancy check algorithm that is used to detect errors in data transmission or storage. It generates a 16-bit checksum (also known as a CRC value) based on the data being checked, which can then be used to verify the integrity of the data.

Two common applications of CRC16 include, Networking Protocols (such as ethernet) and Storage Systems (such as hard-drives) to verify the integrity of the stored data. 

**Huffman Coding**
This method starts by constructing a binary tree. It proceeds bottom up, combining leaves into 'twigs', twigs into 'branches' and so on until the tree is built. 

Huffman Encoding is used in MPEG compression and in compression algorithms like LZW in Zip.
